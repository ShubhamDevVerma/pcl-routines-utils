C/C++ Code to demonstrate the detection (fitting) of line, plane or sphere in given point cloud, using RANSAC (Random sample consensus).
Point Cloud is loaded from .pcd file provided as an argument.
USAGE:
./<executable name> <filepath> <-l/-f/-sf>

<filepath>: .pcd file to load point cloud
-l        : perform line fitting
-f        : perform plane fitting
-sf       : perform sphere fitting
